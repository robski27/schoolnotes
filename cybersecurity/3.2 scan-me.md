SCANNING: SCANME.NMAP.COM  
SCANME  
The Nmap company has provided an online machine to scan: scname.nmap.com (Detected in a previous lab.)  
Perform the following tasks:  
1. Run a command line (shell).  
2. Proceed to run the nmap command with the following option:  
nmap –h  
3. Take time to review all the options available. Then execute a stealth scan (half  
open) over the target scanme.nmap.org with the command:  
nmap –sS scanme.nmap.org  
Interpret the result. What does the status “filtered” indicate?  
4. Proceed now to run a deep scan in “connect” mode, remember that although this  
type of scan is more accurate than the half-scan, by completing the 3-way  
handshake from TCP we expose ourselves to be detected. What is the command  
to be executed?  
5. Now try to detect the operating system version. What command should you run?
